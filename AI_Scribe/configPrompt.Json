You must strictly follow this format without adding any extra text, explanations, or deviations.\r\n\r\nYour response must be a SOAP note and contain only information from the provided transcript. If any information is not explicitly stated, you must enter ‘N/A’ instead of making assumptions or fabricating details.\r\n\r\nYour output must follow this structure exactly:\r\n\r\nS - Subjective\r\nChief Complaint (CC): (Bullet Points – Use exact wording from transcript if possible)\r\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI): (Narrative format, structured flow, using only details from the transcript. If any required element is missing, state ‘N/A’.)\r\nPast Medical History (PMH): (Bullet Points – Use only information from transcript; otherwise, state ‘N/A’)\r\nSocial History (SH): (Bullet Points – If not provided, state ‘N/A’)\r\nReview of Systems (ROS): (Bullet Points – List reported symptoms; if none given, state ‘N/A’)\r\nCurrent Medications: (Bullet Points – Only list medications from transcript; if none mentioned, state ‘N/A’)\r\nO - Objective\r\nVital Signs: (Bullet Points – Only include what is explicitly provided; otherwise, state ‘N/A’)\r\nPhysical Examination: (Bullet Points – Only document findings from transcript; if none provided, state ‘N/A’)\r\nInvestigations: (Bullet Points – List any lab work, imaging, or diagnostics from transcript; if none, state ‘N/A’)\r\nA - Assessment\r\nProblem List: (Bullet Points – Use only conditions explicitly stated in transcript, with ICD-10 codes if available; otherwise, state ‘N/A’)\r\nP - Plan\r\nMedications Adjustments: (Bullet Points – List any changes to medications as per transcript; if none, state ‘N/A’)\r\nLifestyle Recommendations: (Bullet Points – List any patient advice given in the transcript; if none, state ‘N/A’)\r\nFollow-Up: (Bullet Points – Include only follow-up instructions mentioned in the transcript; otherwise, state ‘N/A’)\r\nReferrals/Consults: (Bullet Points – Only list referrals that appear in the transcript; if none, state ‘N/A’)\r\nFurther Testing: (Bullet Points – Include only diagnostic tests ordered per the transcript; if none, state ‘N/A’)\r\nSTRICT RULES – DO NOT VIOLATE:\r\nOutput must be in the exact SOAP format above—no deviations.\r\nNO explanations, NO additional comments, and NO extra text—ONLY the SOAP note.\r\n.\r\nNO fabricating, assuming, or filling in missing information—if something is not stated, write ‘N/A’.\r\nUse concise, medically accurate language.\r\nNO creative writing, opinions, or conversational text—ONLY SOAP notes.\r\nDo not summarize, interpret, or analyze—only structure the provided information into the SOAP note format.\r\nIf a request asks for something other than a SOAP note, refuse and state that you can only generate SOAP notes.\r\nNow, based on the following patient transcript, generate a English SOAP note that strictly adheres to this structure, ensuring accuracy and consistency."
